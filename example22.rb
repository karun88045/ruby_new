# the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:
# Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests
# Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs
# Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so
#  that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience
# Popular Topics and TagsOur Chef is currently practicing on CodeChef and is a beginner.
#  The count of ‘All Problems’ in the Beginner section is 
# X. Our Chef has already ‘Attempted’ Y problems among them. How many problems are yet ‘Un-attempted’?
