# question Chef categorises an instagram account as spam, if, the following count of the account is more than 
# 10 times the count of followers.Given the following and follower count of an account as X and Y respectively,
#  find whether it is a spam account.

# The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
# Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y â€” the following and follower
# count of an account, respectively.
