# Janmansh and Jay are playing a game. They start with a number X and they play a total of Y moves.
# Janmansh plays the first move of the game, after which both the players make moves alternatingly.
# In one move, a player can increment or decrement X by 1 If the final number after performing Y moves is even,
#  then Janmansh wins otherwise, Jay wins. Determine the winner of the game if both the players play optimally.
